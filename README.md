your life.. Make a webpage writing about that person adding his/her image. On the top of the
webpage, add the image and name of the person and below that give layout for the rest of the
details. You can use paragraphs, lists, links, images with CSS to give it a decent look. Add a
suitable background color and font style on your webpage. Most of the parts you can make
using HTML but to give it a better look using a bit of CSS.
